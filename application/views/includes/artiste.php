							<p> Life is full of golden moments that create the fondest memories that are forever hidden in our hearts. Writing songs is my way of holding on to these sweet and heavenly moments with the Lord on the Journey He has lovingly allowed me to walk with Him. </p>
							<p>To me writing songs about Jesus is an expression of love, worship and awe. Itâ€™s one way to keep these encounters with Him constantly alive and fresh in my heart. A glimpse into  the wondrous expressions of His loving heart toward me and you.
