							<p> Life is full of golden moments that create the fondest memories that are forever hidden in our hearts. Writing songs is my way of holding on to these sweet and heavenly moments with the Lord on the Journey He has lovingly allowed me to walk with Him. </p>
							<p>To me writing songs about Jesus is an expression of love, worship and awe. Itâ€™s one way to keep these encounters with Him constantly alive and fresh in my heart. A glimpse into  the wondrous expressions of His loving heart toward me and you.</p>
						<p>This is an open invite to every listener to enter in and experience these sweet moments with the Lord as these songs continually play on. Allow yourself to hear and see Jesus more clearly than ever.</p>
						<p>You can not remain the same!!!</p>
						<p>To Him be all glory evermore!!
							Stay blessed !!

							<p>So God can point to us in all future ages as examples of the incredible wealth of his grace and kindness toward us, as shown in all he has done for us who are united with Christ Jesus.</p>

							<p>Romans 8:2 (AMP)</p>
							<p>For the law of the Spirit of life [which is] in Christ Jesus [the law of our new being] has freed me from the law of sin and of death.</p>
